# Repository privacy review — 2026-10-24

## Scope and method

Reviewed the 22 previously tracked files and 83 unique reachable historical file
versions across local/remote Git refs after fetching origin. Used a local pattern
scan for private-key blocks, privileged Supabase keys, Google OAuth secrets,
GitHub/OpenAI/AWS credential formats, credential-bearing URLs, JWTs, literal email
addresses and machine-specific home paths. Also reviewed author/committer email
metadata and commit-message addresses. Manually inspected account.jsx, schema.sql,
config.js and the documentation findings. Newly added/edited documentation is
checked before committing as well. Candidate values are not reproduced here.

This is a source/history review, not a guarantee against every possible secret
format or a live database/dashboard audit. GitHub-only orphaned objects, external
clones/caches, issue attachments, deployment logs and browser session storage are
outside the scanned Git refs. No user data was queried or exported.

## Findings

| Area | Finding |
|---|---|
| Credentials | No matching privileged API keys, private keys, OAuth client secrets, credential-bearing connection strings or session JWTs found in the scanned file versions. |
| Embedded user data | No literal email addresses or embedded account records found in tracked file history. Public repository-owner names/links and service/tool identifiers remain intentional credits. |
| account.jsx | Profile name, email and avatar are read from the current Supabase session at runtime. These are code references, not committed profile values. |
| schema.sql | DDL, constraints, trigger, grants and policies only; no user rows or account dump. It references auth.users by id and does not store account emails/passwords. |
| Source access rules | Schema enables RLS; SELECT/DELETE use auth.uid() ownership, INSERT checks ownership, UPDATE checks both old/new ownership; anon grants are revoked. This review does not independently attest to today's deployed policy state. |
| Public configuration | config.js contains a Supabase project URL and publishable key, which are intended for browser distribution. They are not a service-role/secret key. |
| Git metadata | One personal email identity is present in existing author/committer metadata. It remains exposed in already published commit history. No address is copied into this report. |
| Local paths | Machine-specific home-folder paths existed in three planning documents. The current V3 maintenance copies now use a portable placeholder. Existing main/history copies retain the old values until the relevant changes/history are separately addressed. |

Supabase documents publishable keys as safe for public client source; access to
private rows must be enforced through grants and RLS:
[API key guidance](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/api-keys).
Historical functional isolation checks are recorded in
[V3 verification](V3-VERIFICATION.md); they were not rerun for this documentation change.

## Changes made

- Configured this local repository's future commits to use the maintainer's
  GitHub noreply address derived from the public account id/login. This Git
  setting is local to this repository and shared by its worktrees; it does not
  change global Git settings or other contributors' machines.
- Added repository instructions for future noreply identity, Codex co-author
  attribution, staged-content checks and avoiding personal data in fixtures/docs.
- Added ignore patterns for local environment files, credentials, HAR/session
  diagnostics, logs and database backup artifacts. Ignore rules do not remove
  files that were already tracked or erase Git history.
- Replaced machine-specific paths in the current maintenance planning documents.

## Decision still required: historical email/path cleanup

No published commit was rewritten or force-pushed. Removing author/committer
emails and home paths from old commits would change commit ids and require a
coordinated rewrite of affected branches, followed by force pushes. Commit links
in this changelog and existing references would need to be updated. GitHub may
retain cached objects, pull-request references and old deployments; other people's
clones cannot be erased by rewriting this repository. Obtain explicit approval
before doing that work, and agree which refs to rewrite.

The current documentation changes stay on version/3.0 until a separately approved
merge. Publishing this report does not mean the historical exposure is resolved.

### Proposed cleanup sequence (not authorized or performed)

Affected fetched remote branches at review time:

| Branch | Commits with personal author/committer email |
|---|---|
| `main` | 27 |
| `search-character-and-actor-highlighting` | 14 |
| `version/3.0` | 29 |

1. Coordinate a rewrite window and capture current remote ref ids in a private
   local recovery backup; check for new pushes and any tags/PR refs first.
2. In an isolated copy, map the personal author/committer email to the verified
   owner noreply identity and replace machine-specific home paths in historical
   planning blobs. Preserve names, dates, code changes and genuine tool credits.
3. Regenerate affected changelog commit links, verify tree contents/ancestry and
   scan again. Review the resulting diff and old/new ref mapping before upload.
4. With explicit approval, update affected remote refs using lease-protected
   pushes. Rewriting main needs a production deployment plan, since Vercel may
   redeploy it. Do not fold unmerged maintenance into main as part of cleanup.
5. Refresh both local worktrees and coordinate other clones; inspect GitHub
   commit views and ask GitHub about retained PR/cache copies as needed. Do not
   promise that external copies or historical deployments disappear.

Keeping history intact and protecting future commits is also an available choice.
